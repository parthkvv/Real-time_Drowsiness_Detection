### Intelligent Driver Enhanced Assistance System


#### Inspiration
With more and more Automotive Companies aiming to achieve level 4 autonomy, there is still a lot left to be done. That being said, Driver safety in vehicles is critical and is therefore currently our top priority in near future. With numerous cases of driver's inattentive nature, because of either closing their eyes due to excessive sleep or emotional condition are the main reasons for accidents. So, why not make a Vehicle Intelligent by making the infotainment system take care of the driver's attention on the road, and improve the mental and emotional state prior to and during driving, thus making it more pleasurable and safe. Also, who doesn't like Personalized entertainment options.

#### What it does
Our software detects drowsiness of the driver, by constantly monitoring Eyes-Aspect-Ratio(EAR), and a voice alert is sent to the Infotainment System if the driver is detected to be drowsy. Following this, the Infotainment System also recommends nearby places for refreshments which includes cafes, restaurants, rest areas, hotels along with the distance.

In addition, the software also detects the emotions of the driver and based on this, the software suggests some songs which can be added to playlist queue, personalizing his ride and making it more enjoyable for the driver.
